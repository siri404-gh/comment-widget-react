Create a commenting widget where:

    Users can leave comments with a name/handle. (single level)

    Users can reply on other comments .

    Each comment should show what time it was posted.

    Bonus for users can up-vote/down-vote comments. You need to show the no. of votes of a comment next to it.

    Bonus points for allowing nesting of replies to multiple levels. UI should handle it.

    Bonus points for showing FB-like timestamps eg. â€œa few seconds ago", "5 minutes ago".
    Bonus points for good UI.
    Bonus points if it's easily pluggable into existing websites as a widget.


Keep in mind:

    Please try avoiding use of any library or framework except for ReactJS.
    You can add any features you see fit, which could differentiate the product from other similar products already in the market or improve usability.
    Object-oriented JS code is a plus!
    You can contact me if you have any doubts or questions.
